                    <h2>How is it Possible?</h2>
                    <p>The concept of a grateful alcoholic is a common one if you hang around a 12 step program for any length of time. This is because the program of action as outlined in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous has worked for them in a positive way. The condition for them to take the steps and have this program available to them was the fact that they were alcoholic.</p>
                    <p>If they weren't alcoholic, they wouldn't have taken the steps and discovered a way of life that contains great joy without alcohol - something many people had thought to be impossible when they first put down the drink. </p>
                    <p>In the rooms of recovery you will hear <em>"We are not a glum lot"</em> along with <em>"We absolutely insist on enjoying life."</em></p>
                    <p>The common cause for joy and satisfaction with their current life is often attributed to their higher power.</p>

                <section class="article-a">
                    <h2>What if I Don't Believe in God?</h2>
                    <p>Although the 12 step program is firmly based in the fact that the release from alcoholism comes from a higher power it remains flexible and inclusive.</p>
                    <p>New members are often encouraged to come up with their own conception of a higher power and as they progress through the steps it is common for this conception to change.</p>
                    <p>There is emphasis that this program is spiritual in nature rather than religious. This distances itself from religious institutions which can be beneficial depending on the individual.</p>
                    <p>There is a chapter in the Big Book titled <em>"We Agnostics"</em> which can help the individual navigate the steps even if they remain skeptical on the higher power idea.</p>

                    <h4>Step 1 <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation"></i></h4>
                    <p></i><em>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol â€” that our lives had become unmanageable.</em></p>
                    <p>I think this step can be boiled down into you have a problem with alcohol and it's making life difficult for you. This is the acknowledgement of a problem.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content content--2">
                    <h4>Step 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-hand-point-up"></i></h4>
                    <p><em> Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</em></p>
                    <p>The second step is faith-based even if that individual does not consider themselves to be spiritual. This is the belief that restoration lies outside the individual and their mind. Even if the individual isn't firm on their belief or conception they are encouraged to continue with the steps. If an individual is having trouble in believing that there is an external force outside of themselves it is suggested they make the group their higher power - often referred to as <em>GOD (Group of Drunks).</em> </p>
                    <p>The second part of this step is that this power can restore us to sanity and aid us in our recovery.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content content--3">
                    <h4>Step 3 <i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i></h4>
                    <p><em>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.</em></p>
                    <p>This step is the acknowledgement of a higher power and the acceptance of aid from that power. If the individual is skeptical they are encouraged to keep an open mind and continue with the steps.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content content--4">
                    <h4>Step 4 <i class="fa-solid fa-pencil"></i></h4>
                    <p><em>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</em></p>
                    <p>This step usually consists of a written inventory in which a person analyzes themselves and their past behaviour. There are four areas that the Big Book suggests looking into and they are your resentments, your fears, your actions with others, and a sexual inventory.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content content--5">
                    <h4>Step 5 <i class="fa-solid fa-user-plus"></i></h4>
                    <p><em>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</em></p>
                    <p>This is the act of reading your written fourth step to another human being. This is often a sponsor or another person the individual feels comfortable with. This a difficult step and the act of being vulnerable to another human being can be deterring for some individuals.</p>
                    <p>It is not uncommon for the individual to feel relief upon completion of this step -- feeling like a weight has been lifted from them. This is an act of confession and is used in many other spiritual paradigms around the world.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content content--6">
                    <h4>Step 6 <i class="fa-solid fa-person-rays"></i></h4>
                    <p><em>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</em></p>
                    <p>This step states that we were ready for our higher power to remove aspects about ourselves that make our life difficult. The work done in Step 4 often reveals patterns and character traits that have impacted us and others in a negative way.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content content--7">
                    <h4>Step 7 <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i></h4>
                    <p><em>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</em></p>
                    <p>This step states that we humbly ask our higher power to remove these defects of character that we discovered as we did our Step 4.</p>
                    
                </div>
                <div class="step-content content--8">
                    <h4>Step 8 <i class="fa-solid fa-list"></i></h4>
                    <p><em>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</em></p>
                    <p>This step is simply a list of all the people we hurt along with the willingness to make amends to them. This step can be unnerving for some individuals as they sense the impending difficulty when making amends to certain people. In this case they are encouraged to merely make the list as a starting point.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content content--9">
                    <h4>Step 9 <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake"></i></h4>
                    <p><em>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</em></p>
                    <p>This is the act of making amends to the people on the list you made in Step 8. This can be a difficult step for the individual and careful thought should be put into each decision on when and how to approach people.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content content--10">
                    <h4>Step 10 <i class="fa-solid fa-compass-drafting"></i></h4>
                    <p><em>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.</em></p>
                    <p>Now comes the <em>"Maintenance Steps"</em> and Step 10 is the act of honestly examining ourselves and our actions. When we do something wrong we take corrective measure and make it right.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content content--11">
                    <h4>Step 11 <i class="fa-solid fa-person-praying"></i></h4>
                    <p><em>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</em></p>
                    <p>Another <em>"Maintenace Step"</em> and Step 11 is the act of improving our connection with our higher power through prayer, meditation, or any other methods that work for the individual.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content content--12">
                    <h4>Step 12 <i class="fa-solid fa-headset"></i></h4>
                    <p><em>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</em></p>
                    <p>The final step, this states that we have had a spiritual awakening and found relief from alcoholism. We now carry this hopeful message to other alcoholics who need it. It also states that we practice what we have found in everything we do from now on.</p>

            <button class="btn-how-it-works">How It Works</button>
            <div class="how-it-works-content">
                <p>Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who
                    do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple
                    program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with
                    themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born
                    that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which
                    demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who
                    suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have
                    the capacity to be honest.
                    Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and
                    what we are like now. If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to
                    any length to get it â€” then you are ready to take certain steps.
                    At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we
                    could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was
                    nil until we let go absolutely.
                    Remember that we deal with alcohol â€” cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too
                    much for us. But there is One who has all power â€” that One is God. May you find Him now!
                    Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.
                    Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:
                     1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol â€” that our lives had become
                    unmanageable.
                     2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
                     3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we
                    understood Him.
                     4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
                     5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature
                    of our wrongs.
                     6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
                     7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
                     8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends
                    to them all.
                    (OVER)
                     9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so
                    would injure them or others.
                    10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly
                    admitted it.
                    11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with
                    God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the
                    power to carry that out.
                    12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this
                    message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.
                    Many of us exclaimed, â€œWhat an order! I cant go through with it. Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these
                    principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines.
                    The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather
                    than spiritual perfection.
                    Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and our personal adventures
                    before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:
                    (a) That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives.
                    (b) That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism.
                    (c) That God could and would if He were sought.
